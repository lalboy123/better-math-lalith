        <Section title="What are cookies?">
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you
            visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their
            websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, {COMPANY_NAME}) are called
            &quot;first-party cookies.&quot; Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are
            called &quot;third-party cookies.&quot; Third-party cookies enable third-party features
            or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
            content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize
            your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
            certain other websites.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Why do we use cookies?">
          <p>
            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
            technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as
            &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also
            enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
            our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising,
            analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="How can I control cookies?">
          <p>
            MathLift does not currently show an in-app cookie preference banner. You can control
            cookies through your browser or device settings (block or clear cookies, or use private
            browsing). Analytics cookies load only when the environment supports them and are used
            to understand aggregate usage of MathLift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classroom progress is stored in Firebase using your class code and student nickname —
            that is app functionality, not advertising cookies. If you prefer not to use analytics
            cookies, configure your browser to block third-party or analytics cookies; MathLift
            lessons will still work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific analytics cookies that may be served, when supported, are described below:

        <Section title="What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?">
          <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use
            other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called
            &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or &quot;clear gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files
            that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
            Website. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one
            page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand
            whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a
            third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email
            marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
            function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

        <Section title="Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?">
          <p>
            Websites may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also known as Local Shared
            Objects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to, among other things, collect and store information about
            your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.

            placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how
            to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are

          <p>
            Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising
            through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and
            other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that
            you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the

            beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to
            provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you.
            The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify
